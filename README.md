Basic Interpreter : █░░░░░░░░░ 10%

## Features (Not final)

- **Strongly typed**: Cedar is a strongly typed language, which means that you need to declare the type of your variables before you use them. This helps to prevent errors and makes your code more readable.
- **Object-oriented**: Cedar supports object-oriented programming, which allows you to organize your code into classes and objects. This makes it easier to manage complex programs and data structures.
- **Functional programming**: Cedar supports functional programming, which allows you to write code that is both efficient and expressive.
- **Memory safety**: Cedar uses Rust's ownership and borrowing system to ensure that memory is managed safely and efficiently.
- **Garbage collection**: Cedar has a garbage collector that automatically frees memory that is no longer in use. This helps to prevent memory leaks and other common programming errors.
